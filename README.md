ou will work with two datasets:
COVID-19 dataset (e.g., daily confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries by country and date)


Worldwide Happiness dataset (e.g., happiness scores, GDP, social support, health, freedom, etc.)
The main goal is to analyze, visualize, and combine these datasets to derive insightful correlations and understand global trends.
In this project, you will load and explore the COVID-19 and Happiness datasets, clean and preprocess the data, and conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends, patterns, and relationships. You will create meaningful visualizations using libraries such as matplotlib, seaborn, or plotly, and merge both datasets to analyze correlations between pandemic impact and happiness indicators such as GDP, life expectancy, and social support. You will then generate insights by answering questions like whether happier countries had better COVID-19 outcomes, and summarize your entire process with clean, well-commented code and visual outputs in a structured Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb). Optionally, you can also present your findings in a single-page HTML summary for sharing.
